# Rock-or-Mine-Prediction-ML-Project
Machine Learning Project
 
The data set was used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network. In this project I have created a machine learning model using logistic regression algorithm. The project is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a Mines and those bounced off a rock. 
It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm. It uses probability to predict the outcome. All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.

Model : Logistic Regression

# Advantages:

1. Highly efficient
2. Doesn't require high computation power
3. Easy to implement, easily interpretable
4. It doesn't require scaling of features.
5. Logistic regression provides a probability score for observations.

# Disadvantages:

1. Logistic regression cannot handle a large number of categorical features/variables.
2. It is vulnerable to overfitting.
3. It can't solve the non-linear problem with the logistic regression which is why it requires a transformation of non-linear features.
4. Logistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other.
